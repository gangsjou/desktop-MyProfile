   <p>I was born in the Netherlands and my parents migrated to Australia to look for new opportunities and better weather. 
      I still speak a little Dutch and understand it but not very well. My brothers and I grew up in the seaside resort of 
      Ocean Grove and attended primary school there. We went to Queenscliff High School which doesn’t exist anymore. I went 
      on to work as a clerk for a large international company (International Harvester) and then re-educated myself in 
      Library and Information Studies, which I loved. I worked in the industry in schools for many years. I am interested 
      in many things. My hobbies include making a variety of things such as quilts, books, leather goods, and toys. </p>
